# SeparateCameras

SeparateCameras is a mod for Lethal Company that makes a few quality-of-life improvements to the terminal `view monitor` radar.

* the terminal `view monitor` radar is now controlled separately from the radar shown on the map screen, allowing the terminal user to `switch` freely without impacting the map screen, and vice versa

* you can now `switch <number>` to switch radar views based on player number (1-indexed), e.g. `switch 1` will switch to the first player

* A very small tweak that improves accuracy of fuzzy-matching for `switch <playerName>`
